# Ingredients

* Nutella
* Peanut Butter
* Chocolate Chip Cookies

# Directions

1. Take a cookie and spread a healthy dollup of nutella on it. 
2. Add a healthier dollup of peanut butter. 
3. Top it with another chocolate chip cookie. 
4. Change your pants.

I used [Tate's chocolate chip cookies](https://www.tatesbakeshop.com/cookies/chocolate-chip-cookies.html) because I happened to have a bag at the ready but if you want to go the extra mile you could make your own. I think the crispyness of the Tate's really worked here to help balance the creamy gooiness of the nutella and peanut butter with a nice crunch.
