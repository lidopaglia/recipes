## Ingredients

* 2 cloves of garlic
* 1/4 of a large white onion (diced)
* 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* 2 tbsp crushed red pepper flakes
* Parsley (Chopped)
* 1 cup cherry tomatoes (cut into halves)
* 1/2 cup crushed tomato
* 1 can tuna fish
* 1/2 lb. of rigatoni pasta

## Directions

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a generous amount of salt to the water once boiling and add in the pasta. Cook the pasta until it is [al dente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_dente) (about 8 minutes).

While the pasta is cooking in a large sauce pan over medium-high heat add 4 tablespoons of olive oil, onion, garlic, and the crushed red pepper. Let the garlic and onion sautee until the onion becomes clear and the garlic turns to a nice golden brown. Reduce the heat to medium adding in the cherry tomatoes, crushed tomato sauce, and tuna fish while stirring. While the sauce is cooking chop the parsley, reserving 1/4 of the chopped parsley for garnish, adding the rest to the sauce.

Once the pasta is done, add the strained pasta to the sauce and raise the heat. You may add 2 or more tablespoons of pasta water to the sauce to thicken. Continue to cook pasta in sauce while stirring so the pasta can combine with the sauce.

Remove from heat and plate the pasta. Garnish with the reserved parsley. Top with grated [Pecorino Romano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecorino_Romano) and serve.
